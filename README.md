# PROGRAMMING-MODELS


This repository contains examples and explanations about the different programming models, including:

## 1. Imperative Programming

Imperative scheduling focuses on how tasks are performed through statements that change the state of a program.

**Common languages:** C, Python, Java.

## 2. Declarative Programming

Declarative programming describes what should be done, without specifying how to do it.

**Common languages:** SQL, Prolog, Haskell.

## 3. Functional Programming

A paradigm that treats computing as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state changes.

**Common languages:** Haskell, Scala, Lisp.

## 4. Object Oriented Programming

Object-based model, where instances of classes (objects) interact with each other.

**Common languages:** Java, Python, C++.

## 5. Logical Programming

In this paradigm, logical rules are used to express facts and queries.

**Common languages:** Prologue, Mercury.


## Programming models project

1). Design patterns

2). Creative patterns

3). Structural patterns

3). Patterns of behavior

4). Anti-patron

5). Components

The idea of the project is to be able to provide different models and tools that help me understand 
from the smallest system to the most complex system and be able to find the solution to them also to know how 
the different fields of work work where I can develop myself as a programmer

First advance (October fourth)

- User Stories

- CRC cards

- Class diagram

At least we must present these three items but a more detailed report of the project must also be made
